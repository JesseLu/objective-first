%
%     Subroutine cstep
%
%     The purpose of cstep is to compute a safeguarded step for
%     a linesearch and to update an interval of uncertainty for
%     a minimizer of the function.
%
%     The parameter stx contains the step with the least function
%     value. The parameter stp contains the current step. It is
%     assumed that the derivative at stx is negative in the
%     direction of the step. If brackt is set true then a
%     minimizer has been bracketed in an interval of uncertainty
%     with endpoints stx and sty.
%
%     The subroutine statement is
%
%       subroutine cstep(stx,fx,dx,sty,fy,dy,stp,fp,dp,brackt,
%                        stpmin,stpmax,info)
% 
%     where
%
%       stx, fx, and dx are variables which specify the step,
%         the function, and the derivative at the best step obtained
%         so far. The derivative must be negative in the direction
%         of the step, that is, dx and stp-stx must have opposite 
%         signs. On output these parameters are updated appropriately.
%
%       sty, fy, and dy are variables which specify the step,
%         the function, and the derivative at the other endpoint of
%         the interval of uncertainty. On output these parameters are 
%         updated appropriately.
%
%       stp, fp, and dp are variables which specify the step,
%         the function, and the derivative at the current step.
%         If brackt is set true then on input stp must be
%         between stx and sty. On output stp is set to the new step.
%
%       brackt is a logical variable which specifies if a minimizer
%         has been bracketed. If the minimizer has not been bracketed
%         then on input brackt must be set false. If the minimizer
%         is bracketed then on output brackt is set true.
%
%       stpmin and stpmax are input variables which specify lower 
%         and upper bounds for the step.
%
%       info is an integer output variable set as follows:
%         If info = 1,2,3,4,5, then the step has been computed
%         according to one of the five cases below. Otherwise
%         info = 0, and this indicates improper input parameters.
