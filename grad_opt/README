c-go: A constrained gradient optimization package for matlab.
============================================================
    
What is it?
-----------
c-go is a very simple matlab package that performs mathematical optimization based on the gradient, as well as constraints on the optimization variable.

How does it work?
-----------------
To obtain a locally optimal result, you simply feed your problem into c-go and hit execute (enter)! The problem description consists of functions that evaluate:

1.  the optimization objective,
2.  it's gradient, and 
2.  the constraints on the optimization variable.
