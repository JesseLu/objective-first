Seems to work...sorta. Residual easily gets stuck around 2e-2 but maybe that's okay?


Now...
======

1.  Get E-field to work.

Next...
=======

1.  Bring in mode-solving and simulation files into this repository.
1.  Merge back into H-field branch.
1.  Merge back into master.
1.  Try various other couplers: 
    "Fiber mode"
    plasmonic wg
    PC wg
1.  Also, investigate L-bend, it seems like all you need is a disconnected blob.

Issues
=======

1.  Figure out residual does not go all the way to zero.
1.  Find out how to avoid phase "pits".
