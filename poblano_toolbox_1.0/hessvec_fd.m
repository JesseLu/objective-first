%HESSVEC_FD   Hessian vector product finite difference approximation.
%
%   HV = HESSVEC_FD(V,FUN,X) computes a forward finite difference
%   approximation of the Hessian vector product, H(X)*V, where V is given 
%   and H(X) is the Hessian of the function FUN at the point X. The
%   approximation is given by
%
%              G(X+S*V) - G(X)
%     H(X)*V = ---------------
%                     S
%
%   where G(X) is the gradient of the function FUN at the point X and 
%   h is the difference step (default = 1e-8*(1+norm(X)).
%
%   HV = HESSVEC(V,FUN,X,GX) uses GX for the value of G(X), in the
%   case that is has already been computed outside of this method.
%
%   HV = HESSVEC(V,FUN,X,GX,S) uses S as the difference step.
%
%   This method should not be called directly, but only by Poblano Toolbox
%   optimization algorithms.
%
%   The number of calls to FUN is kept track of in the global variable
%   NFEV_HESSVEC_FD to facilitate using this method as a callback function
%   (e.g., from an iterative linear solver such as Matlab's SYMMLQ).
